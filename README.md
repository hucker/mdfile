# `MDFile` Overview
A utility that dynamically imports content from external files or commands into your Markdown documents. 
Perfect for keeping code samples, data, and command outputs in sync with your documentation.

MDFile supports directly copying data into Markdown files using the following format:

```markdown
# My Project - {{$version}}

Check out this function:

{{file example.py}}

Files used in this project:
{{process ls -a}}

 
```

After running `mdfile`,  you would have where each of the {{}} macros are expanded into the file.

````markdown
# My Project - 0.1.0

Check out this function:

```python
def hello():
    print("example")
```

Files used in this project:
```text
mdfile.py __init__.py
````

`mdfile` is able to convert CSV files to Markdown tables as well as pretty print JSON files. Most
file inclusions will autodetect the format based on the file extension to enable browsers to 
syntax highlight as needed.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Import Methods**: Import files directly or capture command outputs
- **Smart Formatting**: Automatically applies correct syntax highlighting based on file extension
- **Table Formatting**: Converts CSV data into well-formatted Markdown tables
- **JSON Prettification**: Properly formats and highlights JSON data
- **Direct Markdown Insertion**: Markdown files are imported directly.
- **Variable Expansion**: Commonly used variables are available (e.g., $version)

## Quick Example

The following example shows how to use `mdfile` using the markdown comment tags.  These tags allow you
to dynamically update a Markdown file in place since the tags remain after update AND the text between tags 
is ignored when the file is updated again.  This feature is useful, but can be dangerous if you delete
half of a tag pair.

**Source file (example.py):**
```python
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, world!"
```

**In your README.md:**
```markdown
# My Project

Check out this function:

<!--file example.py-->
<!--file end-->
```

**After running `mdfile`:**
````markdown
# My Project

Check out this function:

<!--file example.py-->
```python
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, world!"
 ```
<!--file end-->
````

To make markdown with the output from the `cat factorial.py` shell command.  This can be difficult
to get just right depending on the tool you are trying to use to pipe data from because different
command line utilities behave differently when data is displayed in a tty vs. a pipe. In the example
below the `cat` command is used to copy the data into the Markdown file, but any command can be used.
Keep in mind that some tools act differently when they are generating data for a tty compared to 
when they are piping data into a file.

`<!--process cat factorial.py-->`
```text
def factorial(n:int):
    """Return factorial of n"""
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```
`<!--process end-->`

## Overview
`MDFile` 'converts' different file types to properly formatted Markdown, supporting:
- Code files (.py, .java, .js, and many more)
- Multiple files can be displayed using file globs such as `<!--file *.py-->`.
- CSV files (with table formatting)
- JSON files (pretty printed,with syntax highlighting)
- Markdown files inserted inline.
- Text files (plain text conversion)
- Basic variable substitution.
- Supports Overwrite (<!-- file x.x->) syntax and insertion {{file}} syntax.


**USEFUL NOTE: Paths are relative to the file that you are processing, so if files are in other folders please
reference them to the Markdown file that you are reading from.**


## Installation

If you are interested in development you can just go to GitHub and clone the repository. 

``` bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hucker/mdfile.git
cd mdfile

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

**RECOMMENDED INSTALLATION**
If you are just interested in using `mdfile` as a tool the very best way to do it
is to just install `uv` and run:

```shell
(.venv) chuck@Chucks-Mac-mini mdfile % uv tool install mdfile 
Resolved 9 packages in 20ms
Installed 9 packages in 10ms

 + rich==14.1.0
 + shellingham==1.5.4
 + typer==0.16.0
 + typing-extensions==4.14.1
Installed 1 executable: mdfile
```

And then test it:

```shell
(.venv) chuck@Chucks-Mac-mini mdfile % uvx mdfile --help   

Usage: mdfile [OPTIONS] [FILE_NAME]

  Convert a file to Markdown based on its extension.

Arguments:
  [FILE_NAME]  The file to convert to Markdown  \[default: README.md]

Options:
  -o, --output TEXT               Output file (if not specified, prints to
                                  stdout)
  -b, --bold TEXT                 Comma-separated values to make bold (for CSV
                                  files)
  --auto-break / --no-auto-break  Disable automatic line breaks in CSV headers
                                  \[default: auto-break]
  --plain                         Output plain markdown without rich
                                  formatting
  --vars_file   -j                JSON variable lookup file.
  
  --version     -v                Show version and exit   
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

and you should be off and running using this as a tool to update Markdown files anywhere.

## Basic Usage


The basic command for converting files is:
``` bash
uvx mdfile [FILE_PATH] [OPTIONS]
```
If you don't specify a file, it defaults to `README.md`.
### Command Line Options
``` bash
# Convert a file and print to stdout
uvx mdfile README.md

# Disable automatic line breaks in CSV headers
uvx mdfile README.md --no-auto-break
```

```` markdown
## Configuration

The default configuration is:

<!--file path/to/config.json-->
```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "isStudent": false,
    "grades": [
        78,
        85,
        90
    ],
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "New York",
        "zip": "10001"
    }
}
```
<!--file end-->
````

## File Type Support
`MDFile` supports numerous file extensions allowing MarkDown to correctly syntax highlight:
- Python: `.py`, `.pyw`, `.pyx`, `.pyi`
- JavaScript: `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
- TypeScript: `.ts`, `.tsx`
- Java: `.java`
- C/C++: `.c`, `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cc`, `.hpp`
- Web: `.html`, `.htm`, `.css`, `.scss`
- Data: `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.csv`
- Configuration: `.ini`, `.cfg`, `.conf`
- Shell: `.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh`
- And many more!

These file extensions map use the standard triple back tick text blocks available in Markdown.

## Options for CSV Files
When converting CSV files, you have additional options:
- `--bold VALUE1,VALUE2,...` - Make specific columns bold in the table
- `--auto-break/--no-auto-break` - Control automatic line breaks in CSV headers

## Variable Substitution
`mdfile` supports a basic form of variable substitution.  At this time the following are supported:

| Variable     | Description          |
|--------------|----------------------|
| `{{$name}}`    | `mdfile`             |
| `{{$date}}`    | current date         |
| `{{$time}}`    | current time         |
| `{{$version}}` | build version        |

These values are imported directly into the markdown file with no special Markdown tags, just raw text
this allows you to have text such as

```App **{{$name}}** version **{{$version}}** was created on {{$date}}```

To get the text

App **mdfile** version **0.10.0** was created on 1/1/2024

## Environment Substitution

Environment variables may also be inserted into your markdown files using the following notation:

```text
Root Project Directory = ``{{ENV.PWD}}``
```

```text
Root Project Directory = ``/Users/chuck/Projects/mdfile/src/mdfile`
```
NOTE: `mdfile` aggressively attempts to block publishing API_KEYS into readme documents if you are noticing 
that ENV_API_KEY is not substituting into your readme it is being blocked.  If you must (which you shouldn't)
you can give an API KEY a different variable name.  It is likely that won't work since GitHub knows how to
find the keys by looking at the key itself.

### UVX
If you installed `mdfile` as a `uv` tool then you can run `mdfile` from anywhere using 
the `uvx` tool.

```bash
uvx mdfile ../README_template.md --output ../README.md
```

``` bash
uvx mdfile documentation.md -o updated_docs.md
```

## Disclaimer
This tool was made open source because it is somewhat useful as it grew features over time. It is
not a great example of how to write clean code since it grew organically in several projects. Don't
be too harsh judging the code.
